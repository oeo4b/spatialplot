spatialplot is a mapping program that generates fixed size images given a set of map features. The motivation behind spatialplot was to create a modular, dynamic and optimal program that would use user-defined spatial data to perform interpolation and layering of map features.

Map blocks and layers are dynamically generated by traversing a rooted tree or forest and extracting relevant features. Each node represents a geographical area associated with a set of political or physical boundaries ultimately creating a hierarchical data structure.

A typical political feature graph could contain Earth as the root node, countries at depth 1, states at depth 2 and other sub-political units at higher depths. On the other hand, a structural representation of purely physical geographical features (e.g. coastline, lakes) may be a forest of independent trees each only containing a depth of 1 to prevent the inevitable overlapping of nodes. 

spatialplot uses a spherical mercator projection coordinate system divided into a 2 dimensional square grid. The dimensions of the grid are dependent on a depth or level that further subdivides each block at higher values. At the lowest depth, level 0, given a coordinate range of -180 to +180 degrees, after spherical transformation, for each dimension, the grid would contain 4x4 blocks each with an area of 90*90 degrees^2.

Higher levels allow for higher resolutions for a fixed size block, though resolution is ultimately determined by the polygons associated with your features. Given these constraints, there is no upper bound on the depth of your map.
