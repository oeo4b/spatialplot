spatialplot is a mapping program that generates fixed size images given a set of map features. The motivation behind spatialplot was to create a modular, dynamic and optimal program that could render images using a tree data structure (i.e. features) to represent geographical information.

The two main functions of spatialplot are interpolation and layering. 


## Features

Map blocks and layers are dynamically generated by traversing a tree graph or forest and extracting relevant features. Each node represents a geographical area associated with a set of political or physical boundaries.

A typical political feature graph could contain Earth as the root node, countries at depth 1, states at depth 2 and other sub-political units at higher depths. On the other hand, a structural representation of purely physical geographical features (e.g. coastline, lakes) may be a forest of independent trees each only containing a depth of 1 to prevent the inevitable overlap of nodes. 

## Installation

To install the development version of spatialplot on a *nix system, run the following commands in the shell:

``` bash
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Dependencies

Freetype (http://www.freetype.org/) is required to render text.
